## nopCommerce & docker-compose

I have starting to use nopCommerce.
Nice webshop, but nopCommerce hasn't normal documentation of how to work with Docker and docker-compose. I created little yml with the general setting, you can use in you works or tests

If you installed docker and docker-compose
you can run as a demon
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

look at status
```bash
docker ps
```
you must see, something like
```
